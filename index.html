      <p class="text">
        Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and were used throughout the
        Roman Empire for numbering years, indicating chapters in books, and
        denoting the order of kings and queens. The system uses letters from the
        Latin alphabet to represent numbers, such as "I" for 1, "V" for 5, and
        "X" for 10; however, there is no symbol for zero which can make complex
        arithmetic operations cumbersome.
